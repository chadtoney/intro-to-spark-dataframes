# Data Directory

This directory is reserved for any datasets you want to use with the Spark DataFrames notebooks.

## Usage

The notebooks in this repository create sample data programmatically, so external data files are not required to run the tutorials. However, you can place your own datasets here to practice with real data.

## Supported Formats

The notebooks demonstrate working with various data formats that Spark supports:
- CSV files
- JSON files  
- Parquet files
- Delta tables (if using Databricks)

## Note

All notebooks generate their own sample data, so this folder can remain empty while learning the fundamental concepts.
